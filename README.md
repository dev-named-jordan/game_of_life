# game_of_life

To play the game, go into the "game_of_life" folder, then go into the lib folder and run "ruby gosu_game_of_life.rb". A screen should appear, playing a psychadelic version of John Conway's Game Of Life. To restart the game with a random grouping of live cells, smash that "space" bar. If you've had enough, just press "esc"!

Currently there are a few color patterns laid out in addition to the psychadelic rainbow. In the first conditional statement of the "draw" method, you can experiment with a few different color schemes, by commenting in, and out, different labeled blocks of code, such as "Pink Colors", etc. 

In the update method is a commented out "sleep" feature, when uncommented and or adjusted, you can change the frame rate. Default is 60fps.

Testing done with RSpec
Game made with Ruby, using the Gosu gem.
