# game_of_life

Go into the "game_of_life" folder, then go into the lib folder and run "ruby gosu_game_of_life.rb". A screen should appear, playing a psychadelic version of John Conway's Game Of Life. To restart the game with a random grouping of live cells, smash that "space" bar. If you've had enough, just press "esc"!

Currently there are a few color patterns laid out in addition to the psychadelic rainbow. In the first conditional statement of the "draw" method, you can experiment with a few different color schemes, by commenting in, and out, different labeled blocks of code, such as "Pink Colors", etc. 

Testing done with RSpec
Game made with Ruby, using the Gosu gem.
