# game_of_life

Go into the "game_of_life" folder, then go into the lib folder and run "ruby gosu_game_of_life.rb". A screen should appear, playing a psychadelic version of John Conway's Game Of Life. To restart the game with a random grouping of live cells, smash that "space" bar. If you've had enough, just press "esc"!

Testing done with RSpec
Game made with Ruby, using the Gosu gem.
